4/25/21 Completed reducedRowEchelonForm method.
4/27/21 Bug fix on reducedRowEchelonForm method. Seems to handle my examples of consistent, inconsistent, and dependent matrices correctly.
5/23/21 Completed interpretation of RREF result, determining solution if consistent, and parametric solution if dependent.  Also wrote helper method to round integer values (represented as doubles) that can't be represented in binary accurately to the 15th decimal place.
